I am a second-year PhD student in Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), advised by <a href="https://wu-yuwei-bit.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Yuwei Wu</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Sl6TV7gAAAAJ&hl=en/" target="_blank">Dr. Yunde
                      Jia</a>.
                    I am also a member of the joint PhD program ('TONG Program') with Beijing Institute for General
                    Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI), and I am grateful to be advised by <a href="https://liqing.io/"
                      target="_blank">Dr. Qing Li</a> and <a href="https://zhigao2017.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr.
                      Zhi Gao</a>.
                    Previously, I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from BIT in 2021.
                    <br><br>
                    My research interests lie in Vision and Language, non-Euclidean representation learning, and 3D
                    vision.
                    Specifically, I am interested in building the feedback refining systems for multi-modal models.
